A simple ReSharper extension which enables to show warnings for missing XML Doc comments for types and type members. In contrast to the C# compiler's [CS1591 warning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zk18c1w9.aspx) which emits a warning for all public or protected types and members, this extension provides configuration options (see the following screen shot).
